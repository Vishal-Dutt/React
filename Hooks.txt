Using Hooks we can achieve class component functionalities in functional component

useState provides functional component to manipulate state in functional component
In functional component the new state is created once only as functional components function runs every 
time when the state changes.

so the question arises if functional component function will run every time the new state is create ane the value of the state is set to the initial state?

Ans--> React knows when functional component runs for the first time. When functional component runs for the first time only the useState will call an the new state
is created ans whenever the functional component is rerendered const[varname,setfuntionName] = useState(initialstatevalue) gets skipped.
so useState runs only first time the functional component is rendered.

useEffect provides class component functionalities in class component
with useEffect we can invoke side effect in functional components

Important Point
useEffect are run after render 

Syntax 
useEffect(()=>{
    // code 
},optional dependency arrayfunctionalities)
takes two arguments callbackfuntion and optional dependency array]

First Variation of useEffect
Syntax:
useEffect(()=>{
    // Code
})
If optional dependency array is not passed the useEffect will run a combination of componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
It runs after every render of the functional component

Second Variation of useEffect

Dependency array is passed as as second arguments to the useEffect 
as empty dependency array is passed the useEffect will run only first time afther the first render method So it will behave as componentDidMount.

Syntax:
useEffect(()=>{
    // Code
},[])
