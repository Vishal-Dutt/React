Components --> Components are independent isolated and resuable piece of code just like our fucntions
Components are of two Types 
1. Class Components.
2. Function Components.

JSX is a Combination of HTML and JS code
eg. const el = <h1> Hello </h1>

Babel is basically a transpiler/compiler converts jsx code into js.

Functional Components are used in static UI
Class Components used for Dynamic UI.


State

about the component.

Whenever our state,component changes 
re-render --> reflects the changes done in component on UI.
